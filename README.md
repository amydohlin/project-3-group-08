# Overview
   - Shark Tank (ABC channel business-oriented show) is where newly start-up entrepreneurs come into the show to grab the required amount of funding in exchange with their portion(share) of the business. The business tycoons (presented as Shark) could possibly provide the asked value, or more in exchange of an equity of the business from the pitchers. The end goal for the entrepreneurs who come to the show is to win over the sharks with their business pitch and convince them to invest in their businesses.

# Ethical Consideration
   - This is the reality show where would-be entrepreneurs try to sell their new ideas for business ventures to one or more angel investors (i.e. the sharks) in return for a stake in the business. However, we can observe several tactics being implied by both parties to get the deal going their way. In some cases, an ethical dilemma occurs for certain shark members. In most cases, sharks seem to provide the deal in the area of their expertise, whereas in others, they tend to avoid or even diminish the product value that looks to be competitive with their already existing products on the market. 
  -  Over the period of seasons, the show (Shark Tank) as well as ABC network had been accused of holding fewer amounts of equity in return for pitchers to perform in their show, and thus expose their products to the market. After several Sharks backlashes, the company decided not to withhold any equity of the pitchers coming into the show. This had some negative impact on the show and the number of deals done in the episode seemed to decrease. Pitchers tend to not accept the deal even after providing them with the exact amount that was asked for in return of proportion of their business at stake. One of the possible reasons could be that some pitchers appear on the show just for marketing, targeting the larger group of audience as the show is televised. 
  - There were few instances of pitchers product related to healthcare sector ranging from psychotherapy to blood pressure measurements. Shark seemed with much enthusiasm demonstrated for requiring insured individuals to pour out their hearts and mental health problems into an online business licensed by their insurance company, with absolutely NO discussion - at least in the portion of the negotiations that aired on TV - about the potential privacy implications of this business plan.  Does anyone ensure the privacy of the customers' personal data?  Who owns the data?  What uses can be made of the data by the business running the services?
