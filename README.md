  **Data Analytics Bootcamp Project 3: Shark Tank (Reality Show) Analysis**
  ## Overview
-  Shark Tank (ABC channel business-oriented show) is where newly start-up entrepreneurs come into the show to grab the required amount of funding in exchange with their portion(share) of the business. The business tycoons (presented as Shark) provide the asked value, or more in exchange of an equity of the business from the pitchers. The end goal for the entrepreneurs who come to the show is to win over the sharks with their business pitch and convince them to invest in their businesses.
